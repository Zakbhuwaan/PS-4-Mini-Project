#Professional Skills - 4 -Mini-Project
Rainfall Prediction using Linear Regression

The Dataset is procured from Kaggle.

The project consist of  implementing  Linear Regression upon this dataset, 

by Preprocessing the data,
performing EDA to select the most suitable dependent variable,
splitting the dataset into Train/Test (80/20),
Training the Model, and Evaluating it by testing the accuracy using the Test split.

the End goal gives us a trained model that can predict rainfall in a particular region given the necessary data.
